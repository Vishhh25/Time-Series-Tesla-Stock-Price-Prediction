🚀 Tesla Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning



📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting Tesla’s stock prices using machine learning models for time-series forecasting. Various approaches, including Random Forest Classifier, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), XGBoost, and Lasso Regression, were applied to forecast stock price movements.

🎯 Goals:
Predict whether the stock price will go up or down using a classification model.
Forecast the exact stock price for the next day using regression models.
Compare different models and optimize for accuracy and precision.
📊 Dataset & Preprocessing
Source: Data was fetched using yfinance, containing 3,632 rows × 7 columns.
Data Cleaning: Removed irrelevant columns (Dividends and Stock Splits).
Feature Engineering:
Created Tomorrow column storing next-day closing price.
Added Target column: 1 if next day’s price is higher, 0 if lower.
Calculated rolling averages and moving ratios (2, 5, 60, 250, 1000-day windows).
🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
📌 1. Random Forest Classifier (Binary Classification)
Used to predict if the next day's stock price will increase (1) or decrease (0).
Initial Accuracy: 52% (low precision).
After Backtesting: Precision improved to 67%.
📌 2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network
Deep learning model used for time-series prediction.
Sequential Model: 50 LSTM units per layer + Dropout layers for regularization.
Performance Metrics:
Accuracy: 61.05%
Precision: 61.05%
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 11.97
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 17.51
R² Score: 0.85
📌 3. XGBoost (Gradient Boosting for Time-Series)
Powerful tree-based model for structured time-series data.
Parameters Used: n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=6.
Performance:
Accuracy: 81.48%
Precision: 81.48%
R² Score: 0.94
📌 4. Lasso Regression (Regularized Linear Regression)
Trained on scaled features to predict the exact stock price.
Performance:
Accuracy: 82.54%
Precision: 82.54%
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 6.73
R² Score: 0.95
📌 5. Lasso Regression + PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to retain 95% variance.
Lower accuracy (39.68%) due to loss of important features in dimensionality reduction.
🔥 Results & Model Comparison
Model	Accuracy	Precision	R² Score	MAE	RMSE
Random Forest	52%	67%	N/A	N/A	N/A
LSTM	61.05%	61.05%	0.85	11.97	17.51
XGBoost	81.48%	81.48%	0.94	7.28	11.97
Lasso	82.54%	82.54%	0.95	6.73	11.97
Lasso + PCA	39.68%	39.68%	N/A	N/A	N/A
✅ Best Performing Model: Lasso Regression (without PCA)
Achieved 82.54% accuracy in predicting stock prices.
Lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) among all models.
XGBoost also performed well (81.48% accuracy) but had slightly higher error rates than Lasso.
