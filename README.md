🚀 Tesla Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning





📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Tesla’s stock prices using machine learning models for time-series forecasting. Various approaches, including Random Forest Classifier, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), XGBoost, and Lasso Regression, were applied to forecast stock price movements.

🎯 Goals:

Predict whether the stock price will go up or down using a classification model.

Forecast the exact stock price for the next day using regression models.

Compare different models and optimize for accuracy and precision.

📊 Dataset & Preprocessing

Source: Data was fetched using yfinance, containing 3,632 rows × 7 columns.

Data Cleaning: Removed irrelevant columns (Dividends and Stock Splits).

Feature Engineering:

Created Tomorrow column storing next-day closing price.

Added Target column: 1 if next day’s price is higher, 0 if lower.

Calculated rolling averages and moving ratios (2, 5, 60, 250, 1000-day windows).

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

1️⃣ Random Forest Classifier (Binary Classification)

Used to predict if the next day's stock price will increase (1) or decrease (0).

Initial Accuracy: 52% (low precision).

After Backtesting: Precision improved to 67%.

2️⃣ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network

Deep learning model used for time-series prediction.

Sequential Model: 50 LSTM units per layer + Dropout layers for regularization.

Performance Metrics:

Accuracy: 61.05%

Precision: 61.05%

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 11.97

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 17.51

R² Score: 0.85

3️⃣ XGBoost (Gradient Boosting for Time-Series)

Powerful tree-based model for structured time-series data.

Parameters Used: n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=6.

Performance:

Accuracy: 81.48%

Precision: 81.48%

R² Score: 0.94

4️⃣ Lasso Regression (Regularized Linear Regression)

Trained on scaled features to predict the exact stock price.

Performance:

Accuracy: 82.54%

Precision: 82.54%

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 6.73

R² Score: 0.95

5️⃣ Lasso Regression + PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to retain 95% variance.

Lower accuracy (39.68%) due to loss of important features in dimensionality reduction.

✅ Best Performing Model: Lasso Regression (without PCA)

Achieved 82.54% accuracy in predicting stock prices.

Lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) among all models.

XGBoost also performed well (81.48% accuracy) but had slightly higher error rates than Lasso.
